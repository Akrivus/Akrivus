## About Me
I'm Owen and I love learning about technology, history, and how all of those things mesh together. It's no surprise that my innovative and interpretative problem solving process gravitated me towards software engineering, which I use to realize my dreams and pave a path for others.

Here's some facts about me:
- ðŸ”­ While I search for my next long-term project, I'm trying new things to freshen my craft.
- ðŸŽ® I'm experimenting with LLMs in video games.
- ðŸª´ I grow peppers and strawberries on my balcony with a hydroponic system I built myself.
- â˜• I have an espresso machine.
- ðŸ‘¶ I'm a dad!
