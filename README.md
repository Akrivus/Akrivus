## About Me
I'm Owen and I love learning about technology, history, and how all of those things mesh together. It's no surprise that my innovative and interpretative problem solving process gravitated me towards engineering, specifically software, which I use to realize my entreprenurial visions
and fuel a burning passion for building practical solutions and user experiences.

Here's some facts about me:
- ðŸ”­ While I search for my next long-term project, I'm trying new things to freshen my craft.
- ðŸ‘¶ I'm a dad!
- ðŸŽ® I'm developing an LLM powered rogue-lite called Living Legend.
- ðŸª´ I grow peppers and strawberries on my balcony with a hydroponic system I built myself.
- â˜• I have an espresso machine that I'm always using to prepare the perfect cortado.
