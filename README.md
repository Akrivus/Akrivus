## About Me
I'm Owen and I love learning about technology, history, and how all of those things mesh together. It's no surprise that my innovative and interpretative problem solving process gravitated me towards software engineering, which I used to realize my dreams and now use to pave a path for others to follow in their journey for success.

Here's some facts about me:
- ðŸ”­ I work primarily in C#, but I miss developing in Ruby.
- ðŸŽ® I experiment a lot with LLMs in video games.
- ðŸª´ I grow herbs in a vertical farm on my balcony.
- â˜• I have an espresso machine.
