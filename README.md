## About Me
I'm Owen and I like reading and learning about new things. I've been a software engineer for six years, where I empower organizations by building robust and optimized backend server systems, APIs and services.

Here's some facts about me:
- 🛠️ Currently, I'm updating my portfolio and thinking up ideas for side projects.
- 🔭 I'm exploring new job opportunities.
- 🎮 I'm developing an rogue-like ecosystem game called The Last Dragon.
- 🪴 I built a hydroponic system that grows peppers and strawberries on my patio.
- ☕ I have an espresso machine that I'm always using to chase after the perfect cortado.
- 👶 My wife and I are excited to welcome a daughter in April!
