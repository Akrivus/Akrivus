I've had a portfolio since 2016, the first featuring screenshots of the various games I've made in a static HTML page. Now, I try to be a bit more creative, but it is difficult to be creative with web development when everything is transpiled and minified and mapped, it inherently reduces complexity, but adds complexity when you compare it to a static HTML page.

Enter SvelteKit, I get all the dynamics and frills I need without waiting 30 seconds for it to load. I like it better than React, but the market decides what is best and I seldom see much Svelte on the market.

As you can see, the thumbnail is different from what you see. This portfolio went through multiple iterations, starting with a more "this is my resume on a website" approach, to a "here's pictures of everything I did" to this collection of case studies, because I realized, everyone reading this asks me questions about what I actually do.

I'm a generalist, with full-stack tendencies, so I need to showcase my thinking versus my skills, because I have so many.
