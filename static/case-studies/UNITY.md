After VisualLive was acquired by Unity, I worked in the Unity Reflect organization, developing features to support Unity Reflect and VisualLive's cloud APIs and services.
- Optimized workflows by implementing SSO in React and developing an ASP.NET Core service for importing third-party data, simplifying file import to a one-click process, and boosting productivity.
- Improved load times by 30% and expanded market share by replacing gRPC with WebSocket and FastAPI for streaming 3D rendering, making the solution UWP-compatible for Microsoft HoloLens.
- Reduced hosting costs by 30% by containerizing a Ruby on Rails application with Docker and deploying it to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), allowing reallocation of resources to other functions.
- Developed microservices in Ruby and Sinatra for native 3D model file conversion using FFI, enabling faster project turnarounds and increasing processing efficiency by 80%.
