Block Party is an RPG (role-playing game) engine in Minecraft, made with Minecraft Forge, an API for modifying Minecraft to add new behaviors and features.

The RPG engine works with "scenes" which are JSON files that tell characters how to act and what to say. I created a custom serializer to map strings to functions and parse arguments, enabling content creators to write scenes that interact with the game in advanced ways, such as creating quests, adding narration, and telling stories, all without writing any business logic in code.

There are 329 characters in the default edition of Block Party, representing most of the blocks in Minecraft. I hired a friend to make these textures, and have been given permission to modify the textures to continuously add new characters as new updates are released.

While unfinished, Block Party has been in active development for 3 out of the past 5 years, returning into a phase of active development in 2024 as generative AI demonstrates its versatility, generating scene-plays from prompts and returning structured scene JSON for rapid integration of new storylines.

I put it on here because the screenshots look cool, and the characters have a lot of exaggerated movements due to having a chibi/anime inspiration.

Alongside the versatile cast of characters and the JSON scene-writing system, Block Party features unique Japanese-inspired items, such as a set of samurai armor, and structures used for summoning characters based on Torii gates, which make the sky and trees turn pink and render a silhouette of Mount Fuji.
